/*!
    A collection of Surfaces grouped together.

    Provides an interface for treating a collection of Surfaces as a single Surface. This base class implements a naive
    linear-time intersection routine which simply intersects each ray with every child Surface.

    This class also serves as the superclass for acceleration structures (such as BVHs, KD-Trees) which are responsible
    for performing ray-surface intersection tests against a collection of Surfaces.
