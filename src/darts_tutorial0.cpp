    // The darts basecode provides a number of useful classes and functions
    // We will walk through the basic functionality of the most important
    // ones.

    // Almost all graphics programs have some data structures for storing and
    // manipulating geometric vectors and colors. Darts already provides this for
    // you in vec.h. The Vec<N,T> struct is a template parametrized by the
    // dimensionality N, and the type T. This just means that we can use the
    // same generic code to represent vectors containing different types
    // (floats, doubles, integers, etc) and dimensionalities (2D: 2 floats, 3D:
    // 3 floats, etc).
    //
    // In addition to storing N values of type T, the Vec class provides a
    // number of useful operations to manipulate vectors in bulk or access their
    // elements.
    //
    // We can access the elements of a vector using the [] operator
    // (e.g. myvec[0]), but for 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors you can access the
    // individual elements directly as data *member variables* by name (e.g.
    // myvec.x). Note that this is different than in the Shirley book (Shirley
    // defines member *functions* e.g. x(), to access individual elements in his
    // vec3 class.
    //
    // Most arithmetic operations are overloaded so you can perform element-wise
    // addition, multiplication, etc. You can compute the length, dot product,
    // etc. Take a look at vec.h or the Doxygen documentation.
    //
    // Most of the time we will be dealing with the 3D float
    // version of this structure, and to avoid typing out the full template
    // typename "Vec<3,float>" we define a bunch of type aliases at the bottom
    // of vec.h, so we can use the shorthand "Vec3f" for a 3D vector of floats,
    // etc. There are similar ones for 2D and 4D vectors. We will also sometimes
    // use integer versions of these (e.g. Vec2i)
    //
    // We will use the Vec<T,N> type to represent geometric points,
    // direction vectors, and normals.
    //

    // Let's create some 3D vectors
    // We can initialize them using:
    // 1) the 3-element constructor,
    // 2) from a single scalar, or
    // 3) using the array initializer
    Vec3f v1(-0.1f, 0.20f, -0.300f);
    Vec3f v2(1.f);                  // This is the same as Vec3f(1,1,1);
    Vec3f v3{0.5f, 0.25f, -0.123f}; // Same as Vec3f(0.5f, 0.25f, -0.123f)

    // we can also print out vectors to the console:
    // We can do this with fmt::print (a modern alternative to C's printf and C++ iostreams):
    fmt::print("v1 = {}\n", v1);

    // But darts also provides some output functions (message, success, warning, error).
    // These operate like fmt::print, but colorize the output based on the type of message.
