This base code is provided exclusively for educational purposes/classroom use.
Sharing modifications of this repository online, especially including your
solutions, is expressively forbidden. For example, you may not post your final
implementation in a publicly accessible GitHub/GitLab repository. Since it can
lead to problematic cases of cheating, we are strict about this rule and
regularly search for leaked solutions online.
